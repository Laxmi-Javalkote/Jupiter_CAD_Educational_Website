    <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>{{JUPITETR_CAD_SERVICES}}</strong>.

    <h2>2. Registration & Accounts</h2>
    <p>To register for courses you may need to create an account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity under your account. Notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized access.</p>

    <h2>3. Course Payments & Refunds</h2>
