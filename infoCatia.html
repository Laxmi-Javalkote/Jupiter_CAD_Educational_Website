            <h1><b>What is CATIA ?</b></h1><ul><li>CATIA shifts traditional 3D CAD (<u>computer‑aided design</u>) expectations to cognitive augmented design, which fuses modeling and 
            simulation. Leveraging knowledge, know‑how and proven technology to automate design and systems engineering, CATIA is helping
             to shape a connected world by offering all the features for design of connected objects and experiences powered by
              cyber‑systems.</li><br><br>

           <li> CATIA affords an intuitive user experience, powered by 3D, Web services, and mobile and augmented reality technologies.
             CATIA ultimately allows innovator social communities to collaborate virtually and co‑design experiences. Lastly, through 
             its cyber‑physical systems modeling and simulation capabilities, CATIA is integral to 3DEXPERIENCE-based industry solutions 
             for model‑based systems engineering, enterprise architecture, concept modeling, and ontologies. These solutions enable
              global industry leaders to develop the “Internet of Experiences” – the smart and autonomous virtual experiences that 
              digitally connect products, nature and life in the real world.</li>

        <p>
            <li>CATIA (an acronym of computer-aided three-dimensional interactive application) is a multi-platform software suite for computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), computer-aided engineering (CAE), 3D modeling and product lifecycle management (PLM), developed by the French company<b>Dassault Systèmes</b>

Since it supports multiple stages of product development from conceptualization, design and engineering to manufacturing, it is considered a CAx-software and is sometimes referred to as a 3D product lifecycle management software suite. <br><br><li>Like most of its competition it facilitates collaborative engineering through an integrated cloud service and have support to be used across disciplines including surfacing & shape design, electrical, fluid and electronic systems design, mechanical engineering and systems engineering.

Besides being used in a wide range of industries from aerospace and defence to packaging design, CATIA has been used by architect Frank Gehry to design some of his signature curvilinear buildings and his company Gehry Technologies was developing their Digital Project software based on CATIA.

The software has been merged with the company's other software suite 3D XML Player to form the combined Solidworks Composer Player.
