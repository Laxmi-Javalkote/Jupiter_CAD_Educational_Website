        <h1><b>What is CREO ?</b></h1>
    <p>
       <li> Creo is a family of Computer-aided design (CAD) apps supporting product design for discrete manufacturers developed by PTC.

Creo runs on Microsoft Windows and provides software for 3D CAD parametric feature solid modeling, 3D direct modeling, 2D orthographic
 views, Finite Element Analysis and simulation, schematic design, technical illustrations, and viewing and visualization. Creo can also
  be paired with the Mastercam machining based software.

    <p>
      <li>  Creo Parametric, formerly known, together with Creo Elements/Pro, as Pro/Engineer and Wildfire, is a solid modeling or CAD, CAM, CAE, and associative 3D modeling application, running on Microsoft Windows.

Creo Parametric should not be confused with Creo Elements/Direct Modeling, which was CoCreate ME10 (2D) and or ME30 (3D) CAD Products. The ex-CoCreate CAD Products are now owned by PTC and offered as "Creo Elements/Direct Drafting" and Creo Elements/Direct Modling".

Creo Parametric is an application of a suite of 10 that provide collaborative solid modeling, assembly modeling, 2D orthographic views, finite element analysis, parametric modeling, sub-divisional and NURBS surface modeling, Drafting, and NC and tooling functionality for mechanical designers.

Creo Elements/Pro compete directly with CATIA, SolidWorks, NX/Solid Edge, Inventor/Fusion 360, IRONCAD, and Onshape. It was created by Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC) and was the first of its kind to market.[1]

The software uses a specific file naming scheme, not allowing certain characters (including spaces).
